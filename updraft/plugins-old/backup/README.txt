== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is it important to back up my website? =
Your website is at risk of data loss due to hacking, hardware failure, or accidental deletions. Regular backups ensure you can restore your website anytime.

It depends on how frequently your website content changes. Daily backups are ideal for dynamic sites, while weekly backups may be sufficient for static websites.

= What is included in the free version? =
The free version allows unlimited backups and restores, migration capabilities, and local storage management.

= Why upgrade to JetBackup Premium? =
Premium users get cloud storage options, scheduled backups, priority support, and advanced backup management.

= What are the minimum requirements? =
JetBackup requires PHP 7.4+ and a Linux-based server for optimal performance. Windows is supported but may have limitations due to known PHP issues.

= Is JetBackup suitable for migration? =
Yes! JetBackup creates an exact snapshot of your website. When restored, it maintains the same state, making migrations effortless.
